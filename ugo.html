    <h1>sample content</h1>
    A <b>multi-tier enterprise application</b> consists of two types of: <b> application logic components</b> and <b>
        persistent data objects.</b>
    Application logic components represent actions and define
    methods that perform common tasks such as calculating the order price, customer credit card
    billing, and so on. Session beans model the application logic components as they contain the logic
    to perform the application tasks.
    It is easy and simple to manage the business data present in large organizations as objects rather
    than as relational rows in a database. Business data when treated as objects are easy to handle and
    manage as they are compact in nature .<br>
    Entities are not associated with only EJBS and can be in <b> Java 2 Standard Edition (J2SE)</b>environment. The
    differences between an Entity and a session bean are as follows:

    <li> Entities have a client-visibility and a persistent identity that is distinct from their object
        reference. Each entity is distinct from the other because of their identities. Clients can use
        identities to pass the reference of an entity to other applications. However, this is not
        possible with Session beans. </li>
    <li>Entity bean cannot be accessed remotely, whereas Session beans can be accessed locally as
        well as remotely</li>
    <li> Entity’s lifetime is not dependent on the application’s lifetime. Entity bean have a much
        longer lifetime than a client’s session as it depends on how long the data is present in the data base</li>
    <li>Entities represent data in a storage that is permanent as well as fault-tolerant and hence,
        they are long lasting and can survive application server or database crash. This data can be
        reconstructed in the memory. Hence, it can be said that entity is an in-memory
        representation of persistent data that:</li>
    <li> Can be loaded from persistent store and its field populated with the stored data</li>
    <li> Can be modified in-memory to change the data values </li>
    <li>Can be saved and correspondingly database is updated</li>
